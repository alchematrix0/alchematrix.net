#### Web Develop project with Simi!

Simi, short for Simone, my sister, approached me about her latest school assignment while she was studying design in Halifax in 2017. The concept was a website for a museum, whose location was a deceased artist's home! That artist, was none other than Simi herself and her beloved cat Olyver was the only living soul remaining at the artist's residence to great the museum goers. To capture the ghoulish scene, I created this little fade in and out animation for her landing page and rewrote the stylesheet for a clean crips layout that's more or less responsive as well. Simi is now working at a design agency... named Oliver! And someone out there still doesn't believe in miracles ðŸ˜‡
