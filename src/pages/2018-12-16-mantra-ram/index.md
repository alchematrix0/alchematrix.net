###### Mantra caveat
**If you haven't already, it's essential that you first look over my post on Mantra work before proceeding.**

Ok let's get in to this one. Single syllabic mantras are more like sound seeds, what are known as Bijas (mono-syllabic sounds), so I will refer to this one as a bija as that is what it is more properly speaking.

#### RAM

So what is this bija about? RAM is all about warrior energy. It is used to awaken and excite the warrior power within. This is primarily a masculine energy and highly recommended for anyone who needs to work dynamically. Perhaps you have a difficult task ahead, or a presentation that requires your full presence and enthusiasm, or you're going to do a rock climb, do physical warrior training or even to generally strengthen your inner masculine. These are all good uses of this sound seed and I encourage you to comment below if this mantra helped you, what it helped you with and how you felt it working with you.

#### How to
When beginning to work with this bija, it's a good idea to break it down into it's own bijas.
First, we begin with AH. Intone the AH sound as many times as you need to feel its essence.
When you're ready, add the R and make it RAH, the name given by the Egyptians to the sun but more generally the Solar logos itself.
When you have intoned RAH to the point of feeling its essence, you may add the M sound and make the complete Bija R-AH-M.
The addition of the M sound will add a feminine aspect to this warrior mantra, so let that M create a cooling hum and take time to abide there after you have moved through the heat generating R-AH portion.
