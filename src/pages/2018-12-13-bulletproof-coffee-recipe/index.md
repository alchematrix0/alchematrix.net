Anyone who knows me knows that bulletproof coffee is my favorite meal of the day. I honestly get so excited to make this coffee every single day and I have it down to an art that travels with me in my truck on road trips, up to mountain passes for before a climb and is a staple of home life blender usage[consistently great tasting smoothie recipe], a vast topic unto itself.

Here's the recipe

- Boil 2 cups of water
- While it's boiling, grind 3 Tbsp of your favorite coffee
- Fill a 4 cup mocha pot with hot water, add the coffee grounds (do not over fill, leave room for the grounds to expand!)
- Put the mocha pot on the stove
- Optional bonus points: put hot water into your blender or thermos, then pour it from there in to your drinking cup and keep your spoon in said cup.
- Spoon butter, coconut or MCT oil and coconut sugar (you gotta play with your rations here but I do 1 basically tbsp of each) into your blender or thermos.
- Optional bonus points: incorporate super foods like Laird's super food creamer, maca powder, collagen or whatever else you like to work with (I'm looking at you Cordiceps!)
- Blend or shake that up and enjoy!
