Wonder, such subtle knowing
Beneath the skin is glowing
Easy as can be

Neither the with hunts nor the pulpit
Could even make my hear quit
It's too resilient to break

After all that we've hurt, we've gone too fast
Lingered in what won't last
This is forever

Silence, it is what I love most
What I see with eyes closed
No words can describe

So Love me, love me as your self, please
Only what comes with ease
There is joy in crying
There's such hope in dying

Love me as your self, dear
Only what comes without fear
There is joy in crying
There is hope in dying
